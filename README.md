In this post, I will be implementing a Linear Regression model without relying on Pythonâ€™s easy-to-use sklearn library. This post aims to discuss the fundamental mathematics and statistics behind a Linear Regression model. I hope this will help us fully understand how Linear Regression works in the background.
